// Editorial for the priority Queue or the heaps data structure to findout the maxiumum and the miniumum value in the 
Running Streams 

// Heaps min/max heaps is known as the priority Queue in STL 

1. max heaps 
2. min heaps priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> greater is doing the comparison here

Introduction to heaps and Hashtable/tables Analysis of their function: 


# Type of the problems : 
1. find max/min of n elements 
Example : 10000 students appearing 10 test. 

# Operations : 
1. Insert/push 
2. pop  maximum element
3. get 

What is heaps ? 
1. Binary Tree 
2. Complete Binary Tree --> all level fill except last levels left to right orders 
3. Heap order proiorty  

Use of Heap : 
1. when the elements need to be access having some proiorty associated with it. O(1)
