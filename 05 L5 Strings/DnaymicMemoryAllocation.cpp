# Dynamic Memory Allocation  : 
	- Static Allocation/Compile time Memory Allocation : Actually the Allocation is not done in the RAM itself instead of virtual memory concept is used
	  Symbolic table is made which done the mapping of the virtual memory to main memory
	  * Done by the complier
	- Dynamic Allocation/ Run time memory Allocation  : 
	 * Allow to allocate the memory during runtime 
	 * Memory has two parts Static and Dynamic/ Heap Memory
	 * new and delete two operator is used to done this jobs
	 * Done by the programmer
	 * Memory Leaks when the reference of the objects is deleted 
	 * Visulaized the memory allocated is during when the programs is runnings 


# 2-D Arrays ;
	 * No direct ways to store the arrays in heaps areas 
	 * We need to create a linear arrays and store in pointer arrays then static arrays of two memorys 
	 * 

# Arrays store in the memory :
	 1. Row major order in 2-D arrays 
	 2. Columns major order in 2-D arrays
