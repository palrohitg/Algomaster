# Implementation of Queues : 

	1. Circular arrays Done 
	2. Linked list Based Done
	3. Max Element in every of k-Size Using the DeQue Approaches
	4. Implementation of Max windows problems Done
	5. First non -Repeating Character in the Stream
	6. Implementation of the first non-repeating Character

# Rule is Think Twice and Code Once;


# Finally the Queues operations 

	1. Queues Opertions using the Stacks Based Approaches Interesting problems
	2. All Methods like push, pop, Enqueue


## Some important points  :

	In a normal Queue, we can insert elements until queue becomes full.

	1. getFront 
	2. getRear
