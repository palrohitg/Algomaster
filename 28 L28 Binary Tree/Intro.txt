// Theory and the compelxity analysis vs tradeoff between different data-structure

Binary Tree : 
    Hierachical Data structure unlike the stack and queue 
    Example directory structure, company organizations 


Terms : 
1. Siblings : child of the same parents 
2. Ancestors : All the parent node 
3. Decendent : All all child node 
4. Leaf : not have not children 


Different View of the tree : 
1. top little variations 
2. bottom 
3. left 
4. right 


# Some Importants theory Concepts : ()
1. Diameter of the tree 
2. Sum replacements 
3. Height Balanced Tree AVL trees 
4. Build tree from arrays 
5. PreOrder and PostOrder builds 
6. Right View of the tree 
7. Shorest distances between two nodes
8. longest common Ancestors
