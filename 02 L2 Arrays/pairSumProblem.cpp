/*
 find the pair. 
 Given a sorted array you need to find out the two num means pairs whose sum is equal to k
  * Brute force i=0 to n-2, j=i+1 to n-1 
  * Binary search approach in which find the second numbers which may logN 
  * Two pointer approach  basic approach in which set i=first and the j = N-1 check the condition while i<j
