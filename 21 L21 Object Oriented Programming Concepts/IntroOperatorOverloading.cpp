### Recursion concepts will be more clear when we have the tree, graphs and dynamic programming

## Important Concepts in OOPS Parts

# Operator Overloading :
* It will add or increase the functionality of the Operator which is already predefined like +, -, *, / etcs
* suppose we have two complex numbers like 5 + 6i, 5 + 6i , when c1 + c2 = 10 + 12i means its a complex numbers additions
        * Setters and Getters are used when we have to set the values by using the function
        * Constructors are usefull when we have to set the values at the time of the objects creations
        * Shift Operator left and right Shift ( >> << ) helps us to take cin >> complex and cout << complex which is not defined by  this objects



# Objects Oriented Paradigms :

1. Constructors :
        - Same name as the class
        - Used to initialize the objects
	- Multiple Constructors we have are called Constructors Overloading

2. Copy Constructors:
        - Copy the content of one object to another
        - car d(c); d is the copy in the code
        - we aren't passing the copy but we are reference the address to that why we are using pass by reference

3. Gette
