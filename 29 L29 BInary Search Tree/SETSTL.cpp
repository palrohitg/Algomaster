// SET STL and MultiSET 

/*
	Set STL : It is container which stores the elements means all the elements are unique and order 
	Usage ? 
		- Remove duplicate elements in the arrays 
		- permutation of the elements where repetition is not allowed. 
		- Use the iterator to traversal and deleted any element in the container
	Pair of set : 
		- Also pair of set and various operations are possible 
		- Like lowerbound and uppper bound 
		- Return the pair using the auto iterator 
		- make_pair functions is used to make the pair of integer 
		- find and erase functions is used to find the pair and erase any pair present in the container
		- it->first and it->second first, second pair is useful to print the first and second elements of the container 
		or the name of the iterators
