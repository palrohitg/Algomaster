/*
 Time and Space Complexity of the Algoritm of the wired part of Algorithm
*/

 It helps us to write the Analysis the best Complexity before going to write the code 

 1. Learn about how to derive the Complexity of bubble and Merge sort
 2. Bubble sort Analysis with the help of maths intution
 3. * Time Complexity with Recurrence Methods for Exam point of view
 4. Time Complexity for polynomial evaluation with the help of power function where N > Nlogn> N^2 is the brute kind of solution but the N is better
 5. Fibnonic series for Recursion left this part
 6.
