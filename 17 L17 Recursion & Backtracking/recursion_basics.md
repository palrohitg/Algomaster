Magical Tricks for the Recursion Problems PMI (Principle of mathematical inductions)
====================================================================================
1. find out the base case of the problem 

2. Assume the small subprograms can be solved using recursion 

3. Prove for the current problems using the above hypothesis 

HAPPY CODING :)


PROBLEMS :
1. BINARY SEARCH 
2. POWER OF NUMBER 
3. MULITPLY OF A NUMBER

1. first occurence 
2. last occurence  right->left, left->right 
3. mergesort
4. quick sort
5. fastPower
6. All occurence


Memory allocations :

# static memory allocations :


# dynamica memory allocations : 
	1.new and delete operator is used for the dyanamics memory allocations 
	2.the memory is allocated and deallocated by the coders so must delete the memory after the allocations using the delete operators 
	3.If the memory is not deallocated then this leads to memory leaks and the memory is free when the programs is terminates 


# Interview test Question:
	1. what if the merge sort divide into three parts 
	2. time and space complexity all question no coding question in first round. 
	3. time and works, speed , and work done in how many days
