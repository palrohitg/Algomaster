 # Parts of Recursive Algorithm 
 1. Base Case i.e when to stop
 2. Work towards Base Case
 3. Recursive Call (Call Ourself)

 # Revision part 
 1. Try to make the recursion Tree 
 2. Track that recursion Tree 
 3. Try to explain the things to another in very simple ways

 # Key features of Recursion :
 1. solve for the base when the problem becomes very simple
 2. make the Assumption for the n-1 case 
 3. Prove for the nth element and the problem will be solved

# Import Thinks to Know before implementing the Recursion :
 1. Don't Think deeper means how the problem is going to solve just assume it can be solve(Induction Hypothesis) f(K) true
 2. First write the Recursive Case 
 3. How it will work in Call stack


 # Important Point 
 1. First try the code 
 2. Try to first Think about that how the Recursive tree and call stack is working
