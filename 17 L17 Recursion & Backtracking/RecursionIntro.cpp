 # Parts of Recursive Algorithm 
 1. Base Case i.e when to stop
 2. Work towards Base Case
 3. Recursive Call (Call Ourself)

# Import Thinks to Know before implementing the Recursion :
 1. Don't Think deeper means how the problem is going to solve just assume it can be solve(Induction Hypothesis) f(K) true
 2. First write the Recursive Case 
 3. How it will work in Call stack


 # Important Point 
 1. First try the code 
 2. Try to first Think about that how the Recursive tree and call stack is working
