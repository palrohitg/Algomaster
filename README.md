## **I am Undertaking the 50 Days of code challenges**: :sparkles: :camel: :tada: :rocket: :metal:
	
		- Timing fixed Daily 12pm-4pm Lecuture and Problem Sovling and making video what I am learn.
    	- Try to put the files and every Days Quotes After Doing The Challenges
		- Daily Target of Solving 10 Question Maximum in a Days

## **Some Tips for the good Developer** :
	
		* Read the problem Statement
		* Design the Solution Architecture
		* Code in paper Dry run the code on paper 
		* Run test on paper for the edges cases
		* Then write the code in IDE 
		* Repeat the Cycle
		* DSA is not about how many problems you have solved but how well you understand the problems that u have already solved : Akshay Saini 

## **Some More tips** :
	
		Interviewers look for following:
		0. how well you understood the problems
		1. your step-by-step approach to the solution
		2. does your Algorithm solves the problem statement
		3. can your solution be improved
		4. what is the Time and Space complexity
		5. did you cover the Edge cases
		6. can you Code your approach &
		7. is your code neat, that's all
