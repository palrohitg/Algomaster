/*

You are given two 32-bit numbers , N and M, and two bit position i and j write a methods
to set all bits between i and j in N equal to  M
e.g M becomes a substring of N located at i and starting at i and starting at j

Example :
Input: N = 10000000000
M = 10101, i=2 and j =6
Output: N =  10001010100
