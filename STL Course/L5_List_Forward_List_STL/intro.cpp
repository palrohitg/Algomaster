List STL ==> Doubly linked list 

Operation of list / Advantange 

1. insert/delete at middle (instead vector because we need to shift the elements) O(1) 
2. push_back, pop_back(), insert, erase(index), remove(values)
3. implement the adjacent for graphs using list STL 



Useful operation that can be performed 

1. reverse 
2. sort 
3. pop_front()
4. front() print the front elements 
5. push_front()
6. pop_back()



Forward list : 
1.  Singly linkedlist points to next elements less memory in terms of spaces 
2.  Traverse the linked list in one directions 
3.  Direct access not works 
4.
