## Introduction to Hashtable / HashMaps: 


### Goal to Achieve:
- Insert, Deletion and Search O(1) in average cases. 
- Ordered is not important.
- https://github.com/mercari/hcledit


### Operations:
1. Insert t[h[key]] = value;
2. Delete t[h[key]] = NULL; 
3. Search return queries

## Hash functions : 
- Better if tablesize is a prime number. 


## Collison handling scheme:
- Open hashing 
    - Separate Chaining
- Closed hashing 
    - Linear Probing 
    - Quadratic Probing
- Double hashing
    


### Key component of hashtable: 
- Hash Functions
- Hash Table 
- Collision Handling Scheme  (when multiple values are stored), buy implementing good collision handling scheme

    key - value is associated store key-value mapping 
    - Self Balancing BST to maintain the ordering 
    - Ordering happends internals 
    - Self balacing BST 

    unordered_map mapping the key are not ordered. 
 
    Opeartion :
    1. insert each query in 0(1) insert(k,v)
    2. erase() delete this methods        
    3. find

    value determine the associated contents and key uniquely identify the contents
    boths the key can be predefined or user-defined
    Internally hashtable so the performance will depends upon the hash functions
    Internally it make the pair, so access m.first(key) and m.seconds(values)

    - Implement the solutions in Python 

## What are different data structure that we can use to implment the solutions: 


Must Do Question on Hashing / Hashtables 


1. Duplicate Value I 
2. Duplicate Value II

4. Longest Substrings Without Repeatings 
5. Mutiple in Continuous Subarrays 
6. K Most Frequent elements 
7. Max Length of subarrays with target Sum 
8. Search the longest AP 
9. Number of Subarrays 
10. Longest substrings with atmost k distinct characters
