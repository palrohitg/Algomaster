Subject : Referral for SDE Backend Engineer at Dunzo

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to you because I am very interested in the Software Engineer Backend at Dunzo, and I understand, it always difficult to refer someone whom, we directly not worked in past, but i can assure you , in past i worked with couple of managing products.

As an software engineer with a strong background in backend development, I believe that I would be a great fit for this position. I have extensive experience in designing, developing, and implementing complex software solutions, and I have worked with a range of programming languages and frameworks, including Python, Golang etc.

In my current role at Park+ (Top 15 Linkedin startup India), I have been responsible for designing and implementing a variety of backend solutions, including APIs, microservices, and data pipelines. I have also worked on optimizing system performance and scalability, ensuring that our software solutions can handle high traffic and large data volumes.

I am particularly drawn to Dunzo because of its reputation for innovation and its commitment to using technology and also get a chance to work with amazing team ,learn and build the product from scratch.
